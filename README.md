# The project is about polymorphism from the COP-2805 course. Polymorphism is when obejcts take many forms. In this assigment we had to create multiple classes where they extend to one class. An example from the uploaded project, Shape can take many forms in this case, Cuboid and Cylinder were examples used in the project. We also had to use the extends and implements tools in the project, where 'extends' is where the class inherits from another class, for example the Cuboid and Cylinder classes inherit from the Shapes class. The Shapes class implements the 'Comparable' which is a collection of data implemented to the Shapes class. The output of the project depended on the Test class where we adjusted the volumes to determine and compare which shape has the greater volume or if they were both the same. In both, Cuboid and Cylinder classes, they will have their own methods of how to measure the volumes. In the Shapes class, will compare between the two shapes and return a value. The value returned in the Shapes class will be used in the Test class to print the output that corresponds to the return value. The Test class also contains the measurments of the shapes. With the current measurements in the Test class, the output will be "Cuboid has the greater volume".
